# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Pyspark-and-RNN

## Project Overview:
The aim of this project is to explain the foundations of Deep Learning, in particular the RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) algorithm, and to develop a sentiment classification application on the Sentiment140 dataset using PySpark. Sentiment analysis, is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text, such as a tweet or review. In this project, we leverage the power of PySpark for data preprocessing and the TensorFlow library to build and train an RNN-based sentiment analysis model.

## Dataset
The Sentiment140 dataset is used in this project, which contains 1.6 million tweets with sentiment labels. You can download the dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140
